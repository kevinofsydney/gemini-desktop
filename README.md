### 🚀 Quick Chat - Spotlight for Gemini

**Like macOS Spotlight, but for AI.** Press **`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Space`** (or **`Cmd+Shift+Alt+Space`** on Mac) from anywhere—writing code, browsing, reading docs—and a floating command center appears instantly.

<!-- [INSERT QUICK CHAT SCREENSHOT HERE] -->

<div align="center">

</div>

**What makes it powerful:**

- **🌟 Spotlight-Style Access** — Global hotkey summons Gemini over any app, just like `Cmd+Space` on Mac
- **💬 Floating Window** — Centered, always-on-top dialog that doesn't disrupt your workflow
- **⚡ Zero Friction** — Auto-focuses on input, submit your query, then it vanishes—results appear in your main Gemini chat
- **⌨️ Keyboard-First** — Type, submit with Enter, dismiss with Escape. No context switching required
- **🎯 Smart Positioning** — Appears on your active screen, keeps you in the flow

### 🕵️ Peek and Hide

Press **`Ctrl+Shift+Space`** (or **`Cmd+Shift+Space`**) to toggle the app visibility. First press hides to the system tray — second press restores and focuses the window instantly.

### 📌 Always On Top

Keep Gemini visible while you work. Toggle "Always On Top" mode with **`Ctrl+Shift+T`** (or **`Cmd+Shift+T`**) so you can reference chats without switching windows.

- **ARM64 (Snapdragon/Qualcomm)**: `Gemini Desktop-x.x.x-arm64-installer.exe`

> 💡 **Not sure which to download?** Open Settings → System → About and check "System type". If it says "ARM-based processor", download the ARM64 version.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

> **Note:** This roadmap reflects current priorities and may shift based on user feedback and upstream Gemini changes.

### v0.8.0 — Chat Tabs & Release Notes

- **Tabbed conversations** to keep multiple chats open at once. ([#72](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/72))
- **Release notes discoverability** via Help menu entry and update toast action buttons.

### v0.9.0 — Peek & Hide, Hotkeys & Fixes

- **Peek and Hide toggle** to quickly show/hide the app without losing context. ([#91](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/91))
- **Voice chat hotkey** wired to active tab mic. ([#117](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/117))
- **Updated default hotkeys** — Quick Chat and Peek and Hide use new, conflict-free defaults.
- **macOS fixes** — native Edit menu for copy/paste, tray icon handling, and window frame.

### v0.9.1 — Bugfix Release

- **macOS menubar icon fix** — use template tray assets to avoid stretching. ([#132](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/132), [#134](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/pull/134))
- **Text prediction setup fix** — handle packaged LLM fallback without export errors. ([#133](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/133), [#135](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/pull/135))

### v0.10.0 — Fixes & Updates

- **Auto-update reliability on macOS** — fix the update flow that fails with a generic “auto-update service encountered an error” dialog during 0.9.x upgrades. ([#150](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/150))
- **Native Windows ARM64 build** — ship an ARM64 installer so Windows on ARM devices can run Gemini Desktop without emulation. ([#151](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/151), [#170](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/pull/170))
- **Linux launch stability on modern distros** — prevent the V8 sandbox/native module memory conflict that causes a segmentation fault on KDE Wayland systems like openSUSE Leap 16. ([#158](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/158))
- **Contributor guide** — add CONTRIBUTING.md with dev setup, test commands, and contribution expectations so new contributors don’t have to hunt for process details. ([#169](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/169))

### v0.11.0 — Startup Experience

- **Windows autostart option** — add a setting to launch Gemini Desktop at login, with an option to start minimized to the system tray. ([#159](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/159))

### Future Work

- **Investigate AI Studio support** and feasibility for a better Gemini Live experience. ([#90](https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop/issues/90))

## 🛠️ Development

Built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) + [React](https://react.dev) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bwendell/gemini-desktop.git
cd gemini-desktop

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run electron:dev

# Build for production
npm run electron:build

# Run tests
npm run test:all
```

### Project Structure

```
gemini-desktop/
├── src/
│   ├── main/      # Electron main process
│   ├── renderer/  # React frontend
│   └── shared/    # Shared types & constants
├── tests/         # E2E and unit tests
└── build/         # Build assets (icons, etc.)
```

---

## 🧪 Automated Testing

We take stability seriously. Gemini Desktop is backed by a comprehensive automated testing suite ensuring that core features work reliably and regressions are caught early.

### Our Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components and logic in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure different parts of the system (Electron main process, renderer, localized APIs) work together smoothly.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate real user interactions—clicking, typing, and navigating—to validate full application flows.

### Running Tests

If you're contributing or just curious, you can run the full suite yourself:

```bash
# Run all tests (Unit, Integration, E2E)
npm run test:all

# Run only E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

We believe that a robust test suite is key to maintaining a high-quality experience.

### 🧪 Wayland Support & Testing (Linux)

Gemini Desktop supports native global hotkeys on **KDE Wayland** via XDG Desktop Portals.

- **Manual Testing**: See [Wayland Manual Testing Checklist](docs/WAYLAND_MANUAL_TESTING.md).
- **Automated Testing**: Most Wayland tests are skipped in CI due to environment constraints. For local runs, follow the [Wayland Testing Runbook](docs/WAYLAND_TESTING_RUNBOOK.md).
- **Debug Mode**: Run with `DEBUG_DBUS=1` to enable D-Bus signal tracking (see `docs/TEST_ONLY_SIGNAL_TRACKING.md`).
